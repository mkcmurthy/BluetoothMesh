Building a Samrt LED Light Mesh Network via Bluetooth

This project is to build Smart LED light mesh network using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) 4.0 channel available on Raspberry Pi3 module. The light mesh is created using self-organized algorithm. Web User interface is developed to display the mesh topology of lights to allow User to view the status of light in the topology and to perform the operations(ON/OFF) on them.
